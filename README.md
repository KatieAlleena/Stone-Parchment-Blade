Live Version: <a href="https://katiealleena.github.io/Stone-Parchment-Blade/">https://katiealleena.github.io/Stone-Parchment-Blade/</a>

Instructions: 

Play Stone, Parchment, Blade against the CPU and somehow, save Hyrule. (: 

Stone crushes Blade
Parchment covers Stone
Blade slices Paper

On launch, click your choice! The computer will pick something random and you'll be informed if you've won, lost or tied that round. 

On a win, you get 1 point.
On a lose, the CPU gets 1 point.
On a draw, neither of you get a point.

The game ends when the player or the CPU gets 5 points.

Regardless of outcome, simply click your next choice to reset the scores and play another round.

Difficulties: 
Had to research how to make the computer make choices by itself. We used math.floor in hangman so it was kinda familiar a little bit. 

Forgot a few CSS tricks. Had to spend a chunk of time researching! 

Changed theme from boring old rock paper scissors to Zelda Theme. Added more work for myself in having to create art.

I don't know where to begin to show a pop up victory or loss screen... I kinda wanted to draw more cute fanart? I may skip this.
